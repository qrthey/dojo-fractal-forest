# dojo-fractal-forest

Shows how to draw some fractal trees with java.awt swing in Clojure.
The code base is kept small, about 100 lines including the UI code.

The recursion level for the trees can be specified in the UI.

Some effort has been made to include some randomness so that not all
trees drawn look the same.
